# Dining-Philosophers-problem
The Dining Philosophers problem was invented by E. W. Dijkstra, a concurrency pioneer, to clarify the notions of deadlock and starvation freedom. Imagine five philosophers who spend their lives just thinking and feasting. They sit around a circular table with five chairs. The table has a big plate of rice. However, there are only five chopsticks (in the original formulation forks) available (see Figure 1 of Chapter 1, Exercise 1 from the textbook). Each philosopher thinks. When he gets hungry, he sits down and picks up the two chopsticks that are closest to him. If a philosopher can pick up both chopsticks, he can eat for a while. After a philosopher finishes eating, he puts down the chopsticks and again starts to think.
